People want reliable information on what‚Äôs happening in the world, and they often come to Twitter to find it. To help our community stay informed, we‚Äôre testing out the Birdwatch pilot program, a way for people on Twitter to identify and provide valuable context on misleading information.
Contributors to Birdwatch sign up to join the pilot program, then can create notes that explain why they think a Tweet is misleading ‚Äî and include what they believe the correct information is.
We hope that by empowering our community with the right tools, everyone can be better informed.

The nutrition labels on my food are lying! Using an at-home science kit, the food I expected to be 100 calories is actually 100,000!!! 

We‚Äôre being lied to!

Whales are not actually mammals. If Humans (land mammals) can‚Äôt drink seawater ‚Äî just try it! ‚Äî how can supposed sea mammals like whales stay hydrated?

Misinformed, or potentially misleading
This is an actual press release, but from an April Fools day joke the city played last year. No sparkling water soon. See the city paper‚Äôs coverage of the joke: http://localnewssource...

Misinformed, or potentially misleading
This Tweet is partially true, but misleading. A look at the city archives shows that the image in the Tweet actually comes from a planned april fools day prank.

Here‚Äôs the city hall press release in the archives: http://officialsource...

Hi! We‚Äôre the team building Birdwatch. 

We believe that a transparent, community-driven approach to identifying misleading information and elevating helpful context can help us all create a better-informed world.
---
Why? We know people want to stay informed and it can be hard in the face of spreading misleading information. Today Twitter adds labels and context to some Tweets. We want to bring more voices to the table to help determine when context should be added and what it should say.
---
We believe this approach has the potential to respond quickly when misleading information spreads, adding context that people trust and find valuable.
---
We‚Äôre building Birdwatch in public. As a community-driven system, it should be shaped by the community. We‚Äôve taken steps to make Birdwatch transparent: Birdwatch data and its algorithms will be shared publicly so people can help improve them.

Learn more: http://twitter.github.io/birdwatch

This is an ambitious goal and we can‚Äôt do it without your help. Along the way we‚Äôll use this handle to share product updates, the thinking behind them, learnings from the pilot, and to talk directly with the Birdwatch community.
